1) Setup Python on Windows

Download and install Python 2.7.x (not 3.x series):
 - Python 2.7.11 32-bit - from https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.11/python-2.7.11.msi
 - Python 2.7.11 64-bit - from https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.11/python-2.7.11.amd64.msi

Installation step-by-step:
- Install for all users
- Install it to some directory (I choose 'C:\Python27')
- Install it with all the features
- Next, next, finish, done

2) Get the sources

Download https://github.com/glinscott/fishtest/archive/master.zip, and unzip it to a new directory.
For example, 'c:\fishtest'.

3) User/pass

Create a username/password for yourself at http://tests.stockfishchess.org/signup

4) Running the worker process

Open a windows command prompt (run cmd.exe) in 'c:\fishtest\worker\' and type:
'c:\Python27\python.exe worker.py --concurrency <cores> <username> <password>'
[Option concurrency refers to the number of available cores in your system (not including Hyperthreaded cores!), leaving one core for the OS. For example, on my 4 core machine, I use --concurrency 3.]

5) Let it run :)
